## 4. Website Description
 Welcome to the Aespaverse, a page built to share and celebrate Aespa's innovative music, members, and virtual worlds. Here, you can explore their journey and even learn new things about them by visiting the sublinks in our navigation tab. Whether you’re a long-time fan or new to Aespa’s universe, feel free to keep scrolling!

## 5. Website Outline
- Home: Welcoming page with an overview of aespa and an introduction to the website.
- Members: Detailed member profiles including photos, bios, and fun facts.
- Discography: Collection of albums and singles with a JS-powered music player.
- Showcase: Features aespa’s performances, concept photos, and media highlights through a curated display or slideshow.
- About: Website background, developer credits, and source citations.

## 6. JavaScript Integration
Javascript will be used throughout the website to make it more interactive and engaging for viewers. On the Members page, once you open an individual's member's profile, there will be a slideshow of their pictures from every concept album. Meanwhile, on the Discography page, Javascript will be used to display songs/albums dynamically when users click on different categories. The Showcase page will use an image carousel script, which will be used for readers to scroll through smoothly. Lastly, Javascript will be used for small effects, such as animated buttons and a back-to-top button when the user reaches the bottom of the site.


## 7. Wireframes / Mockups
All wireframes and mockups for the website (Home, Members, Discography, Showcase, and About pages) are included in the Canva design linked below:

# Project Proposal Quarter 3

## Project Overview

This project is a fan-made website dedicated to the K-pop group **aespa**. The website currently contains the following webpages:

* Home
* Members
* Discography
* Quiz
* About

For this quarter, the website will be enhanced by incorporating **HTML forms** to collect user data and reuse the collected data across multiple webpages. The goal of this update is to improve user interaction, simulate real-world website functionality, and demonstrate proper handling of form data using client-side storage.

---


### Type of HTML Form

The proposed HTML form is a **Fan Sign-Up and Preference Form**. This form will be used to collect information from users visiting the website. The form will include the following input elements:

* Text input for the user’s name
* Radio buttons for selecting a favorite aespa member (bias)
* Dropdown menu for selecting a favorite song or album
* Submit button to save the data

### Purpose and Usage

The purpose of the form is to allow users to register as fans and personalize their experience on the website. The information collected will be used to display customized content on other webpages, such as personalized greetings, member-related content, and quiz results. This form simulates features commonly found on entertainment and fan community websites.

### Data Storage Method

The data submitted through the HTML form will be saved on the user’s computer using **JavaScript localStorage**. This allows the information to persist across multiple pages and browser sessions without the use of a server or database.



## Design of New Webpages

To incorperate the use of the HTML form and stored data, 3 new webpages will be added to the website:

### 1. Fan Sign-Up Page

This page will display the HTML form used to collect user information. The form will include labeled input fields and a submit button. Upon submission, the data will be stored in localStorage for later use. <br>

**Page Title:** Join MY-WORLD



### 2. Fan Profile Page

This page will retrieve and display the data saved from the sign-up form. The page will present a personalized greeting and show the user’s selected favorite member and song or album. <br>

**Page Title:** My aespa Profile



### 3. Personalized Content Page

This page will use the saved form data to display customized content such as member-specific messages, images, or quiz results. The content shown on this page will change depending on the user’s preferences. <br>

**Page Title:** Your aespa Experience



## Wireframe Link:

New wireframes will be created for all proposed webpages. Each wireframe will clearly show:

* The page title
* Navigation menu placement
* Section headers
* Text, image, and media placement
* Form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and buttons <br>
