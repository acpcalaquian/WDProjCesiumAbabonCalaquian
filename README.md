## 4. Website Description
 Welcome to the Aespaverse, a page built to share and celebrate Aespa's innovative music, members, and virtual worlds. Here, you can explore their journey and even learn new things about them by visiting the sublinks in our navigation tab. Whether you’re a long-time fan or new to Aespa’s universe, feel free to keep scrolling!

## 5. Website Outline
- Home: Welcoming page with an overview of aespa and an introduction to the website.
- Members: Detailed member profiles including photos, bios, and fun facts.
- Discography: Collection of albums and singles with a JS-powered music player.
- Showcase: Features aespa’s performances, concept photos, and media highlights through a curated display or slideshow.
- About: Website background, developer credits, and source citations.

## 6. JavaScript Integration
Javascript will be used throughout the website to make it more interactive and engaging for viewers. On the Members page, once you open an individual's member's profile, there will be a slideshow of their pictures from every concept album. Meanwhile, on the Discography page, Javascript will be used to display songs/albums dynamically when users click on different categories. The Gallery page will use an image carousel script, which will be used for readers to scroll through smoothly. Lastly, Javascript will be used for small effects, such as animated buttons and a back-to-top button when the user reaches the bottom of the site.
