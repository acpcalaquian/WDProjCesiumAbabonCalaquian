                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Kim Min-jeong was born on January 1, 2001, in Nampo-dong, Busan, South Korea. Growing up in a family with several members in the armed forces (including her father, older brother, and other relatives), she originally considered a career in this field.</p>
                <p>She went to Yangsan Samsung Middle School and learned to play multiple instruments, such as piano and guitar and played various sports such as bowling, kendo, fencing, basketball, and badminton. She was also in the school's dance club. She attended Yangsan Girls' High School until she was discovered by an SM talent scout while performing at a dance festival at her school in 2016. Prior to being scouted, she had never shared her aspirations of becoming a singer with her parents, who were surprised by her decision to audition. She shared that during the audition, she had to sing for more than three to four hours. She was accepted and dropped out of high school to immediately begin her training.</p>
